After you complete your 6 months salary statement from bank; you need Rent agreement; your educational certificates needs to be attested by your country embassy and Doha embassy (you can do this within those 6 months also); you need to clear fingerprints and medical tests and then you'll get your RP & QID. After that you can bring them on tourist visa on your sponsorship which can be extended for upto 6 months (as it was a year ago.

All the teachers I have met are enthusiastic and bubbly. The head teacher Mrs Brennan is very approachable and ameniable.

The wings cross section make it such that most of the air is forced downwards and smaller fraction over the wings; pushing the plane upwards. Air must be moving toward the plane for the wing to push it below. So the aircraft must be moving towards the air; to get this effect. for the smarter ones out there; you should know that; the speed at which the air hits the wings (basically the aircraft speed plus speed of opposing wind) is proportional to the amount of lift given. helicopters are the same; only that the rotor blades; are the wings and they constantly move in at circular path.',\n",

I remember in the middle of one flight; a passenger called the flight attendant and asked; \"\"Why have we stopped?\"\" Uhhh; ...?!\"',\n",
       " \"Technically; a commercial jet can stay still in the air provided we cause the wind to blow at it from the opposite direction at over 600Kmph. This wind must blow towards the nose and through its wings to cause it to get lift force and thus not make any displacement relative to the ground. This wud means it has zero ground speed. An aircraft has two speeds namely groundspeed and airspeed. Airspeed is measured by the amount of air rushing thro' its sensors placed at various points on its outer body.
